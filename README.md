Welcome! This is going to be a repository where I'm going to write about _Game Design_ and _Software Engineering_.

I am a _Computer Systems Engineer,_ there wasn't any subject related to Game Design in my career, it was just related to _Computer Science_,  yet I always asked my Professors to create a Video game that applied that computer science knowledge on video game projects. This way I was evaluated and I was learning more about how to make video games.

Here, you will find game design and Software Engineering topics . I want to make notes that pretty much everyone can understand, there's gonna be some fancy language here and there, but hey, fancy stuff is needed sometimes, especially _Concepts_.
