# Title Screens

Here I will show descriptions of `Title Screen` components. For example, consider this Title Screen.

![Final Fantasy XIII](<../../.gitbook/assets/final fantasy title screen>)

## Common Component List

* [The Game Logo](../../game-components/game-logo.md)
* [Instruction Text](./#instruction-text)
* The Selection Menu
* [The Game Version](./#undefined)
* [The Legal Information](../../game-components/legal-information.md)

Not all games have a selection menu under the Title Screens. They sometimes transition to the next screen, like Super Smash Bros. Ultimate

### Instruction Text

Sometimes games will have an animated text component that will guide the players to let them know they can press a button to continue to the next screen. In the Smash Bros example you can see that there's a `Press Any Button` text that lets the player know that.

### Game Version

A text component that lets the players know what version of the game they are playing. This began to be a common thing when games got the capability to be updated via internet.
