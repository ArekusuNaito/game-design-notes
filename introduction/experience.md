# Experience

As a Game Designer, you will create games, and your game will be the medium where players will find a new _experience_. This is one definition of experience:

> Knowledge or skill that is obtained from doing, seeing, or feeling things, or something that happens which has an effect on you. ~ Dictionary

I mentioned what _Knowledge_ is in [What is Software Engineering](what-is-software-engineering.md#knowledge)?. Experience is empirical knowledge, you acquire this by living a moment of your life and learning.  Experience is an _Intangible_ thing. If you don't know what _Intangible_ means, well, it means it cannot be touched, it's not present in the "physical world". You can touch a gamepad \(it's _Tangible\)_ , but you cannot touch someone's idea, or even your own ideas, since they are in your mind, you cannot touch or feel other's experience.

While as Game Designers we won't be crafting a particular experience, we are rather building a mold of the experience. Why is that? Because every player will have a different experience with the game, some of them will really like our game, they will enjoy their time and have fun. Others will probably dislike it, and won't enjoy and chances are that they will complain about it. This is, given the same input \(the game\), players will have a very different output \(the experience\).  And as mentioned before, our job is to make our game guide the players to a positive experience.

But how are we going to make and guide a player to a positive experience? Well, that's not an easy question to answer, it really depends on the game we are building. _Jesse Schell_ mentions that, as game designers we have to learn from different fields of study, but not all of them at the same time. Let's mention some examples:

* Say we are building a historical _RTS \(Real Time Strategy\)_ Game. If we want to place the correct setting of the game we will have to study the field of History. Remember how in _Age of Empires II_ you can type a cheat code to spawn a _Cobra Car?_  You do this by typing "_HOW DO YOU TURN THIS ON_" \(without spaces\). I always imagined that the name of the cheat code is related to how a car is not supposed to be in the _Middle Ages_. Cars didn't exist in that period of time, an historical RTS has to stick to what happened and what technology was available during that period of time, as a designer we will have to learn History.

* Now, say we are making a simple Air Hockey video game. Players must hit the puck to score a goal to the other player. We need to learn
