# What is Software Engineering?

## Definitions

### Software Engineering

> &#x20;"The systematic application of scientific and technological knowledge, methods, and experience to the design, implementation, testing, and documentation of software"â€”The Bureau of Labor Statisticsâ€”IEEE Systems and software engineering

> " The application of engineering to the development of software in a systematic method." -  Abran, Alain; Moore, James W.; Bourque, Pierre; Dupuis, Robert; Tripp, Leonard L. (2004). Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge. IEEE.



That seems quite understandable. Yet the first word might needs to be defined.

#### Systematic

> &#x20;"Done or acting according to a fixed plan or system; methodical" \~ Dictionary

I defined what a _System_ is in [_"What is Game Design?"_](what-is-game-design.md#system)_. _It's never a bad thing to recall it.

#### System

> " A_ set of elements that interact with each other to solve a problem" ._

This was a definition I heard from my father when I was just a kid. Even in my college, professors would use a very similar definition. We are still making an  emphasis in the first definition, let's move to the next one.

#### Knowledge

> &#x20;Facts, information, and skills acquired by a person through experience or education; the theoretical or practical understanding of a subject. - Dictionary

> &#x20;True, justified belief; certain understanding, as opposed to opinion - Philosophical definition

There are similarities in Spanish

> &#x20;Human capacity to comprehend through reason, nature, qualities and relationships of things. - Spanish definition

It's time for some meta-knowledge. Through this definitions we are reasoning what Knowledge is, and so, we are creating Knowledge about the definition of Knowledge.&#x20;

![Hey ðŸ˜‰, I heard you like Knowledge.](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png>)

And knowledge can be acquired in an empirical way, or through education. `Empirical` means that is based on our own experience, we lived that moment and we can make our own conclusions/observations; we can call this an _internal source_ (ourselves). `Education`, well that's more straightforward, it means we acquired that knowledge from an _external source_. E.g. Our parents, teachers, a YouTube video, _this thing you are reading right now ðŸ˜‰.  _

#### The Software Life cycle

The last part of the definition mentions **design, implementation, testing and documenting. **These are the most common phases of the Software Life cycle. It is worth mentioning that there are different ways to create software, we call these: "_life cycle models"._  Since it's defined with the word: "Cycle", it means it's going to be iterative, we are going to repeat ourselves many many times. Back in the day, the _Waterfall Model_ was reigning supreme, another popular one is the "Agile Life cycle". On a side note, game design is also iterative, a game is polished in every new iteration.

With these concepts we can thoroughly understand the definitions of _Software Engineering._

### _Finally..._

We can try to create a simpler definition:

> Create software through a methodical life cycle.

You could say that "the application of knowledge" it's implicit, since that's what we are doing all the time (unless we do something thanks to our physical reflexes). The "methodical" word comes from the definition of _Systematic_.
