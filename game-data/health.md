# Health

A numeric value that represents the player's health.  Depending on the game, programmers can handle this as integer or float numbers, although usually it's commonly seen to trait them as float values.

### Total Health

The total health the player currently has.

### Current Health

The current health the player currently has.

### Examples

```javascript
let totalHealth = 20;
let currentHealth = totalHealth;

Damage(4); //currentHealth - 4 => 16/20

```

![A bar letting the player know the current and total health.](<../.gitbook/assets/kirby's health>)

![](<../.gitbook/assets/majora's mask health>)
