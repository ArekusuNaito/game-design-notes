# Introduction

Fireplace is a small card game I wanted to make to create an architecture for card games like Magic and Hearthstone, more specifically like Hearthstone. My motivation is to keep improving in making architectures, make things easy not just for me, but for my future me but more importantly, for the sake of the team. I am also using a framework I am making to help my development of any kind of game.

Today's progress is that I managed to update the Battlefield after the AI attacked. It is worth noting that there are no animations at all, everything happens immediately. So, I also have to work on that at some point. I have to find a way to wait for animations, specially since I am using Observables.
