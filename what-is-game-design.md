# What is Game Design?

### Definitions

#### Game Design

> "Game design is the act of deciding what a game should be." - Jesse Schell

> "The process by which a game designer creates a game, to be encountered by a player,from which meaningful play emerges" -  Salen & Zimmerman

#### Game Designer

> "_A game designer uses the interaction of players and rules to create an experience for the audience"_. - Gary Austin

But for all of this, we need to understand what a Game, there are many definitions, seriously. But to me, these include very well pretty much all games, from board games, video games to sports.

#### Game

> “A game is a system in which players engage in an artificial conflict, defined by rules, that results in a quantifiable outcome.”  -  Salen & Zimmerman

> "An activity among two or more independent decision-makers seeking to achieve their objectives in some limiting context A more conventional definition would say that a game is a context with rules among adversaries trying to win objectives." -  Clark C. Abt

But from my experience, there's a missing component in those definitions. That is, _Fun_, these definitions don't mention anything about having Fun.
